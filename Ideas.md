# Ideas & Nodes

## TODO
- [ ] make Africa avg. line special (e.g. dashed)
- [ ] include a list of country colors (Custom color scheme for linecharts)
- [ ] population size is encoded wrongly
- [ ] add legend to map
- [ ] introduce links between plots (structure every plot into a function with list of countries to show/highlight)
- [ ] Uganda Anomaly: 2021-08-19 to 2021-08-25
- [ ] svg size issue (longer than it should be)
- [x] scatter plot "append" issue when changing data - x owned by Alina
- [x] scatter yScale issue (labels below axis)
- [ ] introduce brushing/filter transition (d3_transitions.html of tutorial)
- [ ] Introduce zoom and pan for map

## Notes
- **Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand**
- Plot titles, axis labels, legends
- Include instructions  (?)
- nice design
- Always metric per population size, e.g. vacc/cases per 1 mio (or eq)
- GEODATA for AFRICA: https://gist.github.com/1310aditya/35b939f63d9bf7fbafb0ab28eb878388#file-africa-json

## Common pitfalls
- making the user scroll up/down
- making the user switch between tabs
- use of drop-down menus (without strong justification)
- [un]readable labels
- using "_" in labels
- missing axis labels
- human [un]readable numbers
- if NULL/missing values are shown as zero
- missing interactivity between charts
- animation that is not well justified (and which alternatives were considered and rejected for what reasons)
- using popup views (without strong justification)
