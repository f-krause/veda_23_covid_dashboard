# Ideas & Nodes

## TODO
- **Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand**
- Plot titles, axis labels, legends
- Include instructions  (?)
- nice design
- Always metric per population, e.g. vacc/cases per 1 mio (or eq)
- Use vue.js

## Common pitfalls
- making the user scroll up/down
- making the user switch between tabs
- use of drop-down menus (without strong justification)
- [un]readable labels
- using "_" in labels
- missing axis labels
- human [un]readable numbers
- if NULL/missing values are shown as zero
- missing interactivity between charts
- animation that is not well justified (and which alternatives were considered and rejected for what reasons)
- using popup views (without strong justification)
